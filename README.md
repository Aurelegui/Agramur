This is a web project that challenges me to create a small web application allowing to make basic photo and video editing using your webcam and some predefined images with filters.

Languages:
  HTML // CSS // JAVASCRIPT // PHP // MYSQL // SQL

Here were the challenges: 
  -Use ony PHP language to create your server-side application, with just the standard library.
  
  -Every framework, micro-framework or library that you donâ€™t create are totally forbidden.
  
  -You must use the PDO abstraction driver to communicate with your database, that must be queryable with SQL.
  
  -Application must be free of any security leak.
  
  -Emailing Service for ACCOUNT VERIFICATION // PASSWORD CHANGE // NOTIFICATIONS.
  
  -Take pictures with camera or upload pictures with integrated filters.
  
  -COMMENT and LIKE sections with E-mailing notifications.
